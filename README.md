# EAB - Essential Applications Bash
This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts designed to automate system administration tasks. The scripts are created using Bash commands and cover various features such as file management, backup and restore, task scheduling, system updates, and software installation.
## install.sh
This is a Bash script that installs VSCodium, GIMP, Apache, or performs system updates on a Debian-based system. It provides a menu with four options and automates the installation process using Bash commands. It is suitable for users who prefer the terminal over a graphical user interface.
## prettier-formatting.sh
The script is a Bash script that uses the prettier tool to automatically format files in a specified directory that match certain file types (in this case, js, json, html, and css files).
## document-generator.sh
This script generates documentation for your project based on your code comments and opens it in the default web browser. The script prompts the user to specify the location where the documentation should be generated. It uses jsdoc to generate the documentation, and commits the changes to Git and pushes them to the remote repository.
